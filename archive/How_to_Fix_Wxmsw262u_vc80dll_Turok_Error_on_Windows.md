What is wxmsw262u\_vc80.dll and why is it missing? Wxmsw262u\_vc80.dll is a dynamic link library (DLL) file that is part of the wxWidgets library, which is used by many applications to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The vc80 part of the file name indicates that it was compiled with Visual C++ 2005. The Turok game requires this file to run properly, but sometimes it may be deleted, misplaced, corrupted, or incompatible with your system.
 
Fortunately, there are some easy ways to fix this error and enjoy the game without any hassle. Here are some possible solutions:
 
1. **Reinstall the game.** This is the simplest and most recommended solution, as it will ensure that all the required files are installed correctly and in the right location. To reinstall the game, you need to uninstall it first from the Control Panel or the Settings app, then delete any leftover files and folders from the installation directory. Then, you can reinstall the game from the original disc or download it from a trusted source.
2. **Download and install wxmsw262u\_vc80.dll manually.** If reinstalling the game does not work, you can try to download the missing DLL file from a reliable website, such as [DLL-files.com](https://www.dll-files.com/wxmsw262u.dll.html). Make sure you download the correct version of the file for your system (32-bit or 64-bit). After downloading the file, you need to extract it from the zip archive and copy it to the game installation folder. Alternatively, you can copy it to the Windows system folder, which is usually C:\Windows\System32 or C:\Windows\SysWOW64. Then, you need to register the file using the command prompt. To do that, open the Start menu and type cmd, then right-click on Command Prompt and select Run as administrator. In the command prompt window, type regsvr32 wxmsw262u\_vc80.dll and press Enter. You should see a confirmation message saying that the file was registered successfully.
3. **Update your Windows and drivers.** Sometimes, the error may be caused by outdated or incompatible Windows or drivers on your PC. To fix this, you need to check for any available updates for your Windows and drivers and install them. To update your Windows, go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and click on Check for updates. To update your drivers, go to Device Manager and expand each category of devices. Right-click on any device that has a yellow exclamation mark or a question mark and select Update driver. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the process.
